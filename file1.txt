we explained the basics of the mission – how a mission launches into Space, what the Chandrayaan-1 and Chandrayaan-2 missions were, etc. You can click here to read it. Here, we further explain why a ‘soft landing’ is crucial to the mission, what makes landing on the south pole a difficult feat, and what happens after the landing.

On Wednesday, India's Chandrayaan-3 became the first space mission to land near the south pole of the Moon. "Hon'ble PM of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina sent a message to Hon'ble PM @narendramodi on 23 August 2023 congratulating him & the people of India on the successful lunar landing of #Chandrayaan_3.

With the Lander accomplishing a ‘soft landing’ on the Moon’s south pole, India becomes the only country to have ever done so. Now, a rover, which is a small vehicle that is meant to move around on the Moon’s surface, will come out of the Lander.

When Chandrayaan-3 took off for the Moon on July 14, 


According to ISRO, the mission’s three objectives were to demonstrate a safe and soft landing on the lunar surface, to demonstrate a Rover roving on the Moon and to conduct in-situ scientific experiments.

Soft landing simply means landing at a gentle, controlled speed to not sustain damage to a spacecraft. Amitabha Ghosh, a scientist for NASA’s Rover mission to Mars, explained it in The Indian Express thus: “Imagine a spacecraft hurtling through space, at 10 times the speed of an airplane, having to nearly come to a standstill in order to land gently on the Earth — all in a matter of a few minutes and, more importantly, without any human intervention. This, in a nutshell, is a soft landing.”
